1) Dough
2) Fillings


MAKING THE VARENYKY
Bring a  large pot of water to boil, then add a little vegetable oil.
Roll a piece dough out into a long rope,
about 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter. Slice into approximate cubes. Roll each cube into a ball. Press fat and roll out into a thin circle.
Scoop approximately one heaping teaspoon of filling into the center of the circle.
Fold in half and pinch the edges shut to prevent any filling from falling out.
Slightly flatten to distribute the filling evenly.
Drop into the boiling water.
Cook until the varenyky floats flat on the surface of the water.
Usually this takes about 2 to 4 minutes depending on the size. When it's done,
use a large flat slotted spoon to lift the Varenyky from the water,
allowing the water to drain off.
Place on a rack to drain and allow to cool.
Freeze immediately or saut√© in butter and onions.
